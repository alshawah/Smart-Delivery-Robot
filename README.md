### Smart Delivery Robot
Overview:
The Smart Delivery Robot is an AI-driven simulation that navigates an urban grid to autonomously deliver parcels. This project demonstrates fundamental AI concepts such as environment creation, agent-based navigation, and advanced pathfinding using A* search, along with realistic urban constraints like obstacles, no-entry zones, and one-way streets.

Features
Task 1: Environment Setup

Create an N x N grid (with N between 1 and 6).
Randomly generate delivery points.
Display the environment with clear cells and designated delivery points.
Task 2: Smart Delivery Robot

Define robot actions: move left, right, up, down, and deliver.
Update the robot's position and delivery status.
Validate user inputs and display the grid in a consistent, structured format.
Task 3: Autonomous Navigation

Automatically navigate the robot toward the nearest delivery point using Manhattan distance.
Dynamically update the grid after each move and delivery.
Notify the user upon completion of all deliveries.
Advanced Component:

Enhanced Environment:
Introduce obstacles, no-entry zones, and one-way streets to simulate real-world urban constraints.
Pathfinding and Optimization:
Implement the A* search algorithm to compute optimal paths that avoid obstacles and respect grid constraints.
Dynamically update the robotâ€™s route based on computed optimal paths.
