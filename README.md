## Overview

This project simulates an autonomous delivery system operating within an urban grid environment. The aim is to progressively develop a Smart Delivery Robot that not only navigates and delivers parcels but also optimizes its route using advanced pathfinding techniques. The project is divided into a series of tasks that build from the basic creation of a grid to a fully functional autonomous agent. The final implementations are represented by Task 3 (the regular smart robot) and Advanced Task 2 (the robot with A* pathfinding optimization).

The full source code is organized into separate Python files for each task, and the complete interactive IPython Notebook is also included in the repository. Additional planning diagrams, flowcharts, and a video demonstration are provided as supporting materials.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alshawah/Smart-Delivery-Robot.git
   cd Smart-Delivery-Robot

## Run Individual Tasks:

[Task 1](../main/task1.py)

[Task 2](../main/task2.py)

[Task 3](../main/task3.py)

[Advanced Task 1](../main/AdvancedTask1.py)

[Advanced Task 2](../main/AdvancedTask2.py)


## Interactive Notebook:

Open SmartDeliveryRobot.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab for the complete code with inline commentary and detailed explanations.

## View the Report:

The final report is available as Report.pdf in the repository, which documents the development process, design choices, ethical implications, and planning diagrams.
The project includes flowcharts and a Gantt chart created using PlantUML (for flowcharts) and Mermaid (for Gantt charts). These visual aids were generated directly from code to streamline the design process and save time
